# Eupalinos
===============

Eupalinos is an bash script intended to be used on MacOS that separates and stacks the layers of PSD files into separate png files.  It takes a folder srcdir as its single argument, and for each PSD file f in the folder, it generates a sequence of png files of the form $f_01.png, $f_02.png, â€¦ $f_$N.png, where N is the number of layers in f.psd.  It then places these files in a folder $srcdir_presentation.  It also resizes these files to 25% of the original size and places them in a folder $srcdir_upload.

Suppose that a file Images/A.psd has 4 layers and a file Images/B.psd has 2 layers.  The running the script on the folder Images will produce create a folder Images_presentation

	Images_presentation/
		A_01.png
		A_02.png
		A_03.png
		A_04.png
		B_01.png
		B_02.png

and a parallel folder Images_upload with the smaller images.


## Dependencies
The script uses [ImageMagick](http://imagemagick.org/).  It has only been tested with version 6.8.3-3 and will display a warning if it finds another version.

ImageMagick may be installed with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).  To install Homebrew itself run in the Terminal

	ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
	
If you haven't already, you should also run

	sudo brew doctor
	
Assuming that everything went okay, you may then install ImageMagick with

	sudo brew install imagemagick
